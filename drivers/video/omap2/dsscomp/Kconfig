	help
	  Takes timestamp for each callback and state transition, and
	  logs the last 128 entries (last few frames' worth) in a
	  log buffer.  This is a separate menuconfig in case this is
	  deemed an overhead.

	help
	  Use ISP resizer on video buffers instead of DSS resizer.
	  Could increase performance of playing 720p clip but,
	  have some issues when record 720p with camera.
